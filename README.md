|--| My PLC Automation Projects with Siemens TIA Portal |-------------------------------------------( S )----|

Hi there, Welcome! This repo showcases a full suite of real-world PLC projects - from industrial ovens and coffee machines to conveyor lines and safety controls - all programmed and tested in Siemens TIA Portal. Whether you’re an automation student, engineer, or curious maker, you’ll find ready-to-use ladder logic, smart timer tricks, and stepwise sequencers. Dive in and start building—or learning!

Curious What’s Inside?

• Step-by-step TIA Portal ladder logic files for major automation challenges.

• Project folders: Each one with all source code, diagrams, and comments you need to rebuild, simulate, or customize.

• Examples include:

    • Automatic coffee machine

    • Traffic barrier control

    • Washing machine sequencing

    • Multistage conveyors

    • Elevator logic

    • Security and lighting timers

    ...and more!

Want to know why these Projects matter?

• Practical: Each program solves a real problem, not just textbook exercises.

• Modular: Sequence logic you can reuse, expand, and adapt.

• Educational: Learn with clear rung-by-rung explanation and simple ladder code.

• Efficient: Every file uses the SSS approach—Simplest, Smartest, Safest logic design.
